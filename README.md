## Gametype under development, currently not playable

### Requirements to run the tests

- put `___assets.pk3` in the server main folder, this file must be downloaded by the client.
- setup ***br.gsc*** in a *pk3* file like a stock gametype
  - give the priority to this pk3 over the assets one, because the assets pk3 contains a file named *br.gsc* too
- use the *zh_frenzy* map version of this repo
- use the codextended server extension, i suggest [my fork](https://github.com/raphael12333/codextended-server)

### Some TODO
- Automatize the zone cycle and randomize the locations
- Fill some roofs/holes on the map
- Show the zone on compass
- Create models and animations for skydiving
- Add a `setAnim` GSC command to CoDExtended, like libcod
